  <p>
    I was elected as the ‚ÄúCIO of the Year‚Äù by Midmarket CIO Decisions. I have led the technology visions for large enterprises and startups with team sizes ranging from 10 to 250. I have been a thought leader and a change agent for building high
    performing teams including cultural transformation to maximize efficiencies and profitability. Trusted leadership is my chief competency; nevertheless, I have a deep understanding of technology; I accomplished 5 software architect patent-filings
    at Western Digital. I was the CTO of SoftBooks, Inc. where my technological innovations and business accomplishments were published in Los Angeles Times, BusinessWeek, and Entrepreneur Magazine. People, innovation, accountability, integrity, and
    outstanding customer service have been the core values in driving my team. I go beyond delivering state-of-the-art and secure IT solutions; I strive to grow the business through innovations and business strategies. Yes, I can help.
